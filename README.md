**Indexing on Starknet is still harder than it should be.**

Projects — even outside of gaming — often reach for Dojo just to get an indexer out of the box. That’s a lot of overhead for a basic need.

We're building a super simple way for any Starknet project to index their smart contracts and serve data to their application — without:

- rewriting contracts
- adopting a new framework or learning ECS

Just clean, queryable data — fast.
